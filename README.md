# Python_API_Challenge
API is a powerful tool to gather information across the globe. Using APIs and the skills we learned in previous assignment we will answer the fundamental question: "What's the weather like as we approach the equator?"
While the answer is simple to answer, we will prove it with data.
In this analysis we will generate a list of random 500+ cities across the world and gather their weather information. With the weather data we will plot and perform regression analysis on the following relationships:
* Northern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Southern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Northern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Southern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Northern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Southern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Northern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
* Southern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

Once we complete our analysis we will generate a heat map and determine which city would make the ideal vacation destination based on the weather.
